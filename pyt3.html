    <p>As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

        >>> print("Hello, World!")
        Hello, World!

        Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
        
        C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
        Python Indentation
        Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
        
        Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
        
        Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
        
        ExampleGet your own Python Server
        if 5 > 2:
          print("Five is greater than two!")
        Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
        
        Example
        Syntax Error:
        
        if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!")
        The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
        
        Example
        if 5 > 2:
         print("Five is greater than two!") 
        if 5 > 2:
                print("Five is greater than two!") 
        You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
        
        Example
        Syntax Error:
        
        if 5 > 2:
         print("Five is greater than two!")
                print("Five is greater than two!")

        <p>Python Variables
            In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
            
            Example
            Variables in Python:
            
            x = 5
            y = "Hello, World!"
            Python has no command for declaring a variable.
            
            You will learn more about variables in the Python Variables chapter.
            
            Comments
            Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
            
            Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
            
            Example
            Comments in Python:
            
            #This is a comment.
            print("Hello, World!")
            Test Yourself With Exercises
            Exercise:
            Insert the missing part of the code below to output "Hello World".
            
            ("Hello World")
            
            Start the Exercise
