  <p>Python Variables
    Variables
    Variables are containers for storing data values.
    
    Creating Variables
    Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    
    A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
    
    ExampleGet your own Python Server
    x = 5
    y = "John"
    print(x)
    print(y)
    Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
    
    Example
    x = 4       # x is of type int
    x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
    print(x)
    Casting
    If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
    
    Example
    x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
    y = int(3)    # y will be 3
    z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

    Get the Type
    You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
    
    Example
    x = 5
    y = "John"
    print(type(x))
    print(type(y))
    You will learn more about data types and casting later in this tutorial.
    Single or Double Quotes?
    String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
    
    Example
    x = "John"
    # is the same as
    x = 'John'
    Case-Sensitive
    Variable names are case-sensitive.
    
    Example
    This will create two variables:
    
    a = 4
    A = "Sally"
    #A will not overwrite a

    <p>Variable Names
        A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
        A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        A variable name cannot start with a number
        A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
        A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

        Legal variable names:
        
        myvar = "John"
        my_var = "John"
        _my_var = "John"
        myVar = "John"
        MYVAR = "John"
        myvar2 = "</p>
